Have Scylla.dll in your PATH

Run from Edit >> Plugins.

extract scylla into the ida root dir.

put sculla.py in plugin dir and load via plugin menu and find it after under debugg menu.

Also important that you have environment setting called IDADIR = path /to /dir

Always have this with ida anyway.





again thx to the authers of the tool.

Regards.
